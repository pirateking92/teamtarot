## Description
Team Tarot is a tarot card reading application that, when the user is ready, will deal 3 cards from a 78 card deck of tarot cards, provide an explanation for each, and then give a reading

## Installation

Cassandra requires Go, Node.js, Sveltekit, and Tailwind CSS library

Go - https://go.dev/doc/install
Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/download
Sveltekit - 
  
  With npm installed, we can set up our first SvelteKit application by running a single command in the terminal:
  
  npm init svelte my-first-svelte-app
  
  This will prompt you to select an app template. Let’s use “Skeleton project”. Screenshot showing Svelte app templates Answer the rest of the questions with ‘no’.
  
  Svelte has set up the skeleton code for our first Svelte app. Let’s take a look. First cd into the directory:
  
  cd my-first-svelte-app/
  
  We’ll install the npm packages the skeleton code requires (Svelte + SvelteKit):
  
  npm install
  
  And finally run the SvelteKit server:
  
  npm run dev
