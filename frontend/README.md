## Description
Team Tarot is a tarot card reading application that, when the user is ready, will deal 3 random cards from a 78 card deck of tarot cards, provide an explanation for each, and then give a reading. Each card will appear reversed or upright and their meanings will be displayed accordingly. The type of card whether major or minor will also be printed, each of the three tarot cards printed will provide information about the past, present and the future.

## Project Structure 
Frontend 
- .svelte-kit: This directory contains configuration files and settings specific to the SvelteKit framework. It includes files related to routing, server setup, and other SvelteKit-specific configurations.
- node_modules: This directory holds the dependencies required by the frontend. These dependencies are installed via npm and include libraries and packages.
- src: Where the bulk of the frontend code is. It contains the source code, including Svelte components, JavaScript modules, CSS files, and other assets.
- static: This directory stores static assets.

Backend
